Stephen Popovich's second react practice assignment.

Assignment Instructions:

1. Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below (e.g. in a pargraph).
2. Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
3. Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length)
4. Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black)
5. Render a list of CharComponent where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input fild) as a prop.
6. When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the enetered text.
